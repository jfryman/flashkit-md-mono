# Changelog

## Unreleased

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * release: Flatpak assets are named by RID like every other Linux asset
   (`flashkit-md-vX.Y.Z-linux-{x64,arm64}.flatpak` instead of
   `-{x86_64,aarch64}.flatpak`), so they sort next to the tarballs on the
   release page.

## 1.5.3 (July 18, 2026)

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * release: the Flatpak now installs on the conventional `stable` branch
   instead of flatpak-builder's default `master`, so `flatpak update`
   tracks future releases; the version itself is reported by the
   AppStream metadata (`flatpak info`).

BUG FIXES:

 * release: the Flatpak failed to start on Wayland desktops
   ("XOpenDisplay failed"): the sandbox granted X11 only as a fallback
   when Wayland was absent, but Avalonia is X11-only and needs XWayland.
   The manifest now grants the X11 socket unconditionally.

## 1.5.2 (July 18, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * release: the Flatpak bundle is now also built for aarch64
   (`flashkit-md-vX.Y.Z-aarch64.flatpak`), natively on GitHub's arm64
   runners.

## 1.5.1 (July 18, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * release: releases now ship a Linux Flatpak bundle
   (`flashkit-md-vX.Y.Z-x86_64.flatpak`, app ID
   `io.github.jfryman.FlashKitMD`). The manifest is Flathub-ready and CI
   builds the bundle on every push so it cannot rot between releases.
 * release: macOS binaries and app bundles are Developer ID-signed with
   the hardened runtime, notarized, and stapled, and Windows executables
   are Authenticode-signed, when the corresponding repository secrets are
   configured (see docs/RELEASING.md). Without the secrets, releases ship
   ad-hoc-signed/unsigned exactly as before.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * docs: README.md now targets users — install from release artifacts
   per platform, GUI and CLI usage, screenshot — while building,
   architecture, and release process moved to DEVELOPING.md.

## 1.5.0 (July 17, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * gui: the window now tracks device and cartridge state live — a status
   bar shows whether the programmer is detected (and on which port) and
   whether a cartridge is seated, and cart details (name, ROM/RAM/header
   sizes) auto-refresh every 2 seconds into a structured info panel, so
   the manual "Cart info" button is gone. An empty slot reads
   "No cartridge" instead of "Unknown (X) / 0K".
 * gui: auto-dump — tick "Dump ROM" (and optionally "Dump RAM") and pick
   a folder, and every newly inserted cartridge is dumped there
   automatically, named after the cart header. Existing files are never
   overwritten (a " (2)" suffix is added); reinserting or swapping carts
   triggers a fresh dump, and RAM dumping skips carts without save RAM.
 * gui: auto-write for development loops — tick "Write ROM", acknowledge
   the destructive-action warning (suppressible via "Don't show this
   warning again"), pick an image, and every flash cartridge inserted
   while enabled is erased and reprogrammed with it. Retail (mask ROM)
   carts are detected and skipped by the flash-chip check. Auto-write
   and auto-dump are mutually exclusive; enabling one disables the
   other's checkboxes.
 * gui: the console text dump is replaced by a transaction log: every
   ROM/RAM read/write becomes a log entry with timestamp, file path, its
   own inline progress bar, a status bubble (amber running, green
   success, red failure, gray cancelled), and the outcome (size, MD5, or
   the error) — cancelled pickers are logged too. The global bottom
   progress bar is gone.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * gui: the status bar now sits along the bottom of the window and reports
   cartridge presence ("Cartridge inserted" / "No cartridge") instead of
   repeating the cart name shown in the info panel.
 * cli, gui: suggested filenames for read-rom/read-ram no longer carry the
   ROM header's internal space padding — runs of spaces collapse to one
   (Sonic 3 now suggests "SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3 (U).bin" instead of
   "SONIC THE               HEDGEHOG 3 (U).bin"). The cart-info display
   still shows the header name verbatim.

BUG FIXES:

 * gui: on macOS the programmer appeared permanently disconnected after
   writing a ROM, until the adapter was physically replugged. Closing the
   port after a multi-MB flash write wedges in the FTDI driver's drain;
   the guarded close abandons it, which is fine for the CLI (process exit
   reclaims the descriptor) but left the long-lived GUI process holding
   the port, so every reconnect failed. The GUI now keeps one session
   open for as long as the programmer is reachable instead of
   reconnecting per operation, deferring the close to window close or
   device loss.

## 1.4.1 (July 17, 2026)

BUG FIXES:

 * release: `publish.sh` exited nonzero after a successful single-RID
   publish (as in the CI publish matrix) because the final `ls` listing
   included an `.app` glob that only matches when the macOS targets were
   built in the same run. This failed every CI publish job since v1.3.0;
   release builds were unaffected because they publish all targets
   together.

FEATURES:

 * cli: `--version` prints the version stamped into the build.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * release: binaries, the GUI window title, and the .app bundle are now
   stamped with the version being built — the bare tag on releases,
   `git describe` output (`tag-N-gSHA[-dirty]`) on branch and local
   builds, `dev` when built outside publish.sh.
 * gui: the macOS menu bar and Dock now say "FlashKit MD" instead of
   Avalonia's default "Avalonia Application".

## 1.3.0 (July 17, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * release: macOS releases now ship the GUI as a signed `FlashKit MD.app`
   bundle (`FlashKit-MD.app-vX.Y.Z-osx-{x64,arm64}.zip`) with the
   original client's icon, assembled by `packaging/macos/make-app.sh`.

BUG FIXES:

 * release: the macOS GUI binary in the v1.2.0 tarballs crashed on
   launch anywhere but the build tree — the macOS single-file bundler
   silently leaves the pre-signed Skia/HarfBuzz/AvaloniaNative dylibs
   next to the binary, and the tarballs dropped them (same class of bug
   as v0.9.0's serial lib). The GUI now embeds all content on macOS,
   and `publish.sh` fails if any native library is left beside a binary
   so this cannot ship silently again. Linux and Windows GUI binaries
   were unaffected.

## 1.2.0 (July 17, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * gui: new cross-platform desktop front-end (`src/FlashKit.Gui`,
   Avalonia) mirroring the original WinForms client: Read/Write ROM,
   Read/Write RAM, and Cart info buttons, a console log, and a progress
   bar. Built on `FlashKitSession`; operations run off the UI thread so
   the window stays responsive during multi-MB transfers.
 * release: `publish.sh` and the release workflow now build, sign, and
   package the GUI (`flashkit-md-gui`) alongside the CLI in every
   platform archive.

## 1.1.0 (July 17, 2026)

FEATURES:

 * cli: `read-rom --trust-header` dumps the extent declared in the ROM
   header instead of the mirror-probed size — useful on flash carts,
   where partially programmed flash can make probing misjudge the ROM's
   extent. `info` now prints the header size whenever it disagrees with
   the probed size. (Inspired by joeyparrish/flashkit-md-py.)
 * cli: `write-rom` and `bake-save` now verify a CFI-capable flash chip
   answers on the cart bus before erasing anything, failing fast on a
   mask ROM game cart or an unseated cart instead of reporting a verify
   error after a full "write". `--no-flash-check` skips the check.
   (Inspired by joeyparrish/flashkit-md-py.)
 * core: `FlashKitSession` gains `ReadHeaderRomSize()`, a size override
   on `ReadRom`, `CheckFlash()`, and `skipFlashCheck` parameters on
   `WriteRom`/`BakeSave`; `CartInfo` gains `HeaderRomBytes`.

## 1.0.1 (July 17, 2026)

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * release: the project is now explicitly MIT-licensed — a LICENSE file
   was added retaining krikzz's copyright, matching the license on the
   original sources at github.com/krikzz/flashkit. The README credits
   the original author prominently.

## 1.0.0 (July 17, 2026)

1.0 milestone: hardware validation is complete on all three platforms
(Linux, macOS, Windows) — see docs/hardware-validation.md. Dumps are
byte-identical across platforms and to the original krikzz Windows
client (ROM and SRAM), and write-rom round-trips were verified on real
flash carts including console boot tests.

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * release: GitHub release notes are now extracted from this changelog's
   section for the tagged version; the release fails if the section is
   missing.

## 0.9.2 (July 17, 2026)

BUG FIXES:

 * serial: `write-rom` no longer hangs the process on exit on macOS. The
   FTDI driver's output drain (`tcdrain`, run inside the serial close)
   can wedge forever after a flash write's multi-megabyte output; the
   port close now discards the already-acked output queue first and
   abandons a close that still wedges, releasing the port.

## 0.9.1 (July 17, 2026)

BUG FIXES:

 * release: archives now work standalone — the serial-port native
   library (`libSystem.IO.Ports.Native`) is embedded into the
   single-file binary. v0.9.0 archives shipped without it, so every
   serial open failed with a dlopen error.
 * release: macOS binaries are ad-hoc code-signed. macOS kills unsigned
   arm64 executables on launch, which made the v0.9.0 osx-arm64 binary
   unrunnable without a manual `codesign -s -`.

## 0.9.0 (July 17, 2026)

Initial release: a cross-platform .NET 8 port of krikzz's Windows-only
FlashKit MD programmer client, hardware-validated on Linux.

FEATURES:

 * cli: `info`, `read-rom`, `write-rom`, `read-ram`, `write-ram`
   commands mirroring the original client's five buttons, with a
   `--port` override, progress display, MD5 printout, and read-back
   verification on writes.
 * cli: `write-rom --full-erase` wipes the whole flash chip before
   writing, preventing stale data above the image from appearing as
   corrupted "ghost" save slots on console.
 * cli: `bake-save` programs a save snapshot into flash at the save
   window for SRAM-less flash carts — read-only saves that survive
   power cycles.
 * core: `FlashKitSession` library API (GetInfo, ReadRom, WriteRom,
   ReadRam, WriteRam, BakeSave) so TUI/GUI front-ends build on the same
   tested code as the CLI.
 * core: per-OS serial port auto-detection (Linux `ttyACM*`/`ttyUSB*`,
   macOS `cu.usbmodem*`/`cu.usbserial*`, Windows `COM*`) with
   open/permission errors surfaced instead of swallowed.
 * release: self-contained single-file binaries for linux-x64,
   linux-arm64, osx-x64, osx-arm64, and win-x64, published automatically
   on `v*` tags with a `SHA256SUMS` file.
